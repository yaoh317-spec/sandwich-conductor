# Sandwich Conductor – Ballistic Gas-Channel Conduction (1.0 → N1 → N2)

This repository documents an experimental engineering concept I developed in a short period of time with the help of AI tools (ChatGPT & Grok).  
I am **not** a physicist or a semiconductor engineer.  
Everything here is transparent, open, and fully available for verification or refutation.

My goal is simple:
**If the concept is wrong, I want people to break it.  
If the concept works, I want people to build it.**

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores whether **ballistic electron transport** can be achieved inside a **nano-scale gas channel**, stabilized through a layered “sandwich” structure.  
The idea focuses on **engineering geometry**, not superconducting materials or quantum pairing.

Core principle:

> **Avoid the solid → avoid lattice scattering → allow near-lossless electron transport.**

The system has three main versions:

- **1.0 – Solid + Gas + Liquid** (original)
- **N1 – Pure Gas Channel (no liquid)**  
- **N2 – Pure Gas Channel + Surface Molecular Layer (SAM-like stabilization)**

---

## 📌 Why this is interesting

Across all versions, electrons travel through a **100–200 nm inert-gas channel**, where:

- mean free path λ is greater than channel length L  
- wall scattering is minimized  
- Ramsauer–Townsend transparency applies  
- heat generation becomes negligible due to extremely low R

Estimated performance:

- **1.0:** 5–200× copper  
- **N1:** 10–1000× copper  
- **N2:** Theoretical upper limit unknown (engineering-limited)

## 🧠 Concept Summary

### 1.0  
A graphite channel sealed with liquid to confine a Xe gas layer.  
Electrons travel ballistically through the gas layer.

### N1  
Liquid removed; gas channel stabilized by solid geometry only.

### N2  
Gas channel stabilized by a **fixed surface molecular layer (SAM-like)**.  
Removes all fluid instabilities.  
Provides the most stable and highest-performance version.

## ✔ Physical Notes

This project avoids assumptions about:

- superconductivity  
- Cooper pairs  
- BCS theory  
- exotic materials  

Everything relies on:

- micro-/nano-scale geometry  
- ballistic transport  
- inert-gas scattering physics  
- interface stabilization  
- engineering constraints  

All formulas and reasoning are included in `/docs/`.

## 📫 Contact / Notes

I do not have an academic background in this field,  
and English in this repository was translated with AI tools.

Anyone is free to:

- test the idea
