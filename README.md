I use 3.5nm Xe 4nm graphite 100nm silicone oil in forluma cause i think this is more easy for engineering and more stability less efficiency but more better 


While adhering to the laws of physics, is it possible to achieve near-superconductor performance through structural design?    
The core purpose of this article is to explore whether it is possible to achieve near-superconductor properties through structural design in the absence of a superconductor, rather than achieving the functionality of a 1:1 superconductor.   
1.0 The assumed materials are graphite, gaseous xenon, and silicone oil, forming an example composite structure. Graphite is the core, xe is the interlayer, and silicone oil is the stabilizer.   
(These materials are not required; any equally feasible materials will suffice. This is merely a demonstration of an example structure, aiming for the cheapest materials and the worst possible results. Structural feasibility is based on the minimum feasible standard.)
Assuming the structure is constructed at room temperature on a nanoscale, the possibility of this structure being valid rests with:    
1. Van der Waals forces       
2. mirror potential states   
3. Laplace pressure.    
Vacuuming is required in engineering.   
A.Why can Xe exist near the graphite interface without immediately dissipating?？

Addendum: This structure is only valid at the nanoscale it does not hold true at the macroscopic level.     
B. Why are low-energy bound states of electrons allowed near the interface?？

C. Why doesn't Xe leak out of the nanostructure immediately?

How is extreme smoothness achieved?    
1.structural stability

The two papers show that Xe atoms are tightly locked in by the wrinkles in the graphite.     
Xe is not a randomly moving gas, but rather arranged neatly on the graphite surface.    
It achieves both physical smoothness and stability.    
3.low resistance

U can just google NIST Xenon electron scattering cross section 0.65 eV download pdf verify    
At the nanoscale, electrons are waves, which poses a significant threat to other conductors because it causes disordered scattering. So how can we reduce drag?    
Use Ramsauer-Townsend Effect    
Penetration of waves： When an electron wave approaches a Xe atom, it experiences an attractive force from the atom and accelerates.    
Phase Cancellation： When the energy of an electron is exactly 0.65 eV, the fluctuations of the electron wave inside and outside the atom will produce destructive interference.   
The typical drag zone has a scattering cross-section of 24.5 at 10 eV.   
The voltage in the transparent viewing area plummeted from 0.65 eV to 0.126 eV.   
24.5/0.126=194.444....    
4.Why do electrons only travel on the surface of solids?   
This is the classic Maxwell's boundary condition theory    
At the interface between the conductor graphite and the low-permittivity all free charges of Xe must be distributed on the surface.    

If we assume the above is true up to this point, we have successfully constructed a room-temperature ballistic transport conductor. If subsequent experiments prove otherwise, do not blame me; blame them. I am merely proposing a hypothesis based on existing physics, and I have violated no physical laws.      
Why fail?     
I think the failure is even more important than how I succeeded as mentioned above.     
In terms of the minimum viability of the structure  Silicone oil 50nm Xe 2.5nm graphite 2nm 0.65ev      
You can verify the following calculations yourselves as I can't create PDFs; I can only type text files.   
I believe you can calculate them yourselves, so I don't need to explain.    
There are three maximum possible failures    
1.quantum tunneling    
You can verify it yourselves. I calculated it about three times, and it's approximately 0.00005 1/20000    
2.Phonon scattering     
No object can avoid phonon scattering at room temperature, so the minimum BME in this structure would be fatal, but it is sufficient for testing.    
3.  failure     
A Laplace stress of 16.8 MPa will attempt to flatten a fragile structure.     
Theoretically, the minimum BME is difficult to establish, but this is an engineering problem, not a hypothesis problem. If you want it to be true, you can change the size and it will hold true on its own, but again, it only holds true at the nanometer scale; it absolutely does not hold true at the macroscopic scale.        
Next, you might encounter some minor setbacks.    
1.Atomic level impurities 2.voltage noise 3.Layered impregnation of silicone oil     
These is engineering failure im not pro i dont know hot too fix again u can change material but i can bot promise it could be work.      
4.Space Charge Effect     
It won't dead but it will reduce efficiency and age.   
Maybe has other problem but u could not know this is just a hypothesis need to experiments to know all problems.     

The above is the minimum BME. Can change the materials and dimensions used in the structure to ensure stability and service life.     
Now i can tell why u should test. if u want to keep the stability can test by ownself I'm just providing the worst possible example to everyone.    
The best semiconductors now i know exclude cpo cause i dont know how good is cpo      
The best semiconductors i know TSMC 2nmGAAFET    
Transmission distance 10-40m 1.0 minimum bme is perhaps 560nm      
Resistance source lattice scattering    1.0: Quantum Contact Resistance   
Thermal bottleneck bigggg 1.0: very low      
1.0 electrons do not exchange energy with atoms and therefore do not generate heat. But needs experimentation cant promise and hard engineering.      
I think the cost is low as fuck if u guys want to try to bet on this only need 1 experiment then get answer low win but extra large success.     
Anyway, there's no loss compared to billions of dollars. The calculation and reading of the article probably won't even take 10 minutes.      
The materials can all be replaced. I currently cannot find enough literature to endorse and cite my work Anyway, it's free and open source.      
U might be thinking it so easy why there no one say this?or ai calculate this?cause there is a lot material does not have document too prove it could be combo.  and ai dont have structure.       
If it could work in even 1 fs all can be think it worked.

if it works then u can give some not forcing but i need to buy new gpu if it not work or u think this bullshit just dont need to give any money.
