1.This river-like drawing represents the concept of electrical resistance.
2.This is what my 1.0 structure looks like.
3.This shows how electrons move when the solid is wrapped by liquid and the liquid is wrapped by gas.
4.This is my idea of how superconductors work: an entrance and an exit with a straight, unobstructed path.
5.This drawing represents my thinking process.
6.This is how I imagine electrons being squeezed.
7.This is a diagram of extremely high voltage forcing electrons into a single channel, like squeezing water into a balloon or tube.
